"I am offering free integrative wellness coaching sessions as part of my capstone project. These sessions are for anyone who wants support improving areas of life such as stress, sleep, digestion, nutrition habits, routines, or overall wellbeing. Coaching is not medical or nutrition therapy. It is a supportive conversation where you are in charge, and I help you clarify goals, explore motivation, and take small realistic steps that fit your life. If you are interested, we can also include optional tools like grounding practices, brief meditation, or other wellness topics based on what feels meaningful to you. This space is nonjudgmental, client led, and focused on helping you feel more empowered in your health and daily life."
